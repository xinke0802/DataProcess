This file lists some steps to set up the project before the codes can work.

1. Put the Lucene index folders of tweets and users, "EbolaTweetIndex" and "EbolaProfileIndex", in the parent folder of this folder, which means we should have "..\EbolaTweetIndex" and "..\EbolaProfileIndex" folders. These two Lucene index folders are too large to upload. So you must ask Xiting to copy these folders.

2. Before running the C# codes, you should NuGet the package Stanford.NLP.NER for the name entity extraction part used in the project.
